# Gender-identity-based-on-tooth-measurement

Project description
Forensic medicine is an interesting area of study. Forensic dentistry is a branch of forensic medicine. During natural calamities or due to some other reasons, many times, it will not be possible to find out the gender of the deceased person. In such cases, certain measurements of the tooth will be taken (as bones and teeth do not decay easily) and gender will be determined.
